This repository contains a tutorial on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). It provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing BNNs using simple examples. The tutorial covers the basics of Bayesian inference, neural networks, and how to combine them to create BNNs. It also includes practical examples and code snippets to help you get started with building your own Bayesian Neural Networks.
